Marking Criteria for the First Coursework — The Proposal

1. Is the project proposal at a suitable level for an Undergraduate final-year student who 
is to commit about 300 hours to it? (30 points)

- A really good student should have enough challenges to demonstrate how good they are (ie. the 
project should be tough enough)
A weak student should be able to achieve enough on the project to merit a pass grade (ie. the 
project should not be too tough)
Factors to be considered are whether objectives have been clearly stated, what breadth of 
investigative work needs to be carried out for the project and whether the project makes 
suitable demands enabling a student’s skills to be demonstrated.

2. Is the project plan suitable for achieving project objectives? (50 points)

- Factors to be considered are whether there are a range of specific tasks been identified 
which are clearly related to achieving the stated project objectives and if the plan for 
completing of the stated tasks clear? (eg. ordering of tasks; estimation of task duration; 
identification of milestones; indication of engagement with project supervisor).

3. How good is the written work? (20 points)

- In the formal project proposal, one would expect to see evidence of the student’s ability to 
complete an effective final project report, for example in the proposal’s structure, logical 
presentation, quality of written English, use of diagrams and referencing as well as 
articulate prose. Technical profieciency in English language will also be considered. A 
good proposal is interesting to read.
